# Rental-Demand-Forecasting-using-Time-Series-Analysis (Dutch)


## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting rental demand using time series analysis and statistical modeling techniques. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal effects in rental data and build a predictive model to forecast future demand.

The project demonstrates a full data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and forecasting model development.

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare rental demand data for analysis
- Explore trends and seasonal patterns in rental usage
- Identify relationships between variables
- Engineer time-based features
- Build and evaluate a forecasting model
- Generate data-driven insights for demand prediction

---

## Workflow
The project follows these main steps:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded rental demand datasets
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Prepared data for time series analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized demand trends over time
- Investigated seasonal patterns
- Explored correlations between variables
- Identified demand fluctuations across periods

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created time-based features capturing:
  - Seasonal effects
  - Trend components
  - Time-related variations

### 4. Forecasting Model
- Built a **SARIMAX time series model**
- Trained the model on historical rental data
- Generated demand forecasts
- Evaluated model performance

### 5. Insights
- Demand shows clear seasonal patterns
- Time-related variables strongly influence rental demand
- Forecasting enables better planning and resource allocation
